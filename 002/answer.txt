I agree that TV programs have a positive influence on modern society for several reasons. Firstly, TV programs provide valuable educational content. For example, documentaries on history, science, and nature broaden viewers' knowledge and understanding of the world. Shows like "Planet Earth" offer insights into wildlife and environmental issues, raising awareness about conservation.

Secondly, TV programs can enhance social bonds. Family members often gather to watch their favorite shows together, creating opportunities for bonding and discussion. This shared experience can strengthen relationships and provide a common topic for conversation.

On the other hand, excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and decreased productivity. However, if consumed in moderation and with mindful selection, the benefits of TV programs in terms of education and social interaction outweigh the potential drawbacks​​.
